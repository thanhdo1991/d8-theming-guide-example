# The Drupal 8 Theming guide

Drupal 8 is going to be a huge change for anyone familiar with Drupal 7. For themers, as they are called in the Drupal world, there is a whole new theming layer with Twig, the new template engine.

The goal of the theming guide is to provide you with a complete overview of the front-end changes made in Drupal 8 and to get you started with creating a custom Drupal 8 theme.

Read the full guide using Github pages @ [http://sqndr.github.io/d8-theming-guide](http://sqndr.github.io/d8-theming-guide).
